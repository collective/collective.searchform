Introduction
============

An advanced searchform for Plone 4.2 and above.


The searchform included in this package was in the core until version 4.1
of Plone. It was removed in 4.2 in favour of a more cleaned and simplified
search UI. This package is for all who want or need to retain the 
old functionality.

Installation
============

Just add the egg `collective.searchform` to your buildout, rerun it and restart
your instance.


Usage
=====

Add `search_form` to the URL of your Plone site and you will get a advanced
search form which exposes most of Plones indexes in a search UI.

Compatibility
=============

Plone 4.2 and 4.3
